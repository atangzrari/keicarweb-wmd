          COMPACT SIZE: Kei cars; which is short for "keijidosha" which means light automobile
          are very small cars which are practical for city use.
          These vehicles are built for city use because the size of a kei car is limited to 
          3.4 meters length, a width of 1.48 meters and 2.0 meters in height. These are the 
          legal limitations.

          LOW MAINTENANCE COSTS: Runningthe vehicle day to day is not bad for the wallet.
          the vehicle are simple machines and their small parts are abundent and cheap to replace or maintain.
          The reason for the abundence of parts is due to the sharing ofparts that kei car companies do, that further reduces the sevice cost.

         ECO-FRIENDLY: Kei cars are restricted to engines no larger than 660cc, these resulting in lower 
          carbon dioxide emissions. These engines accompanied by the lightweight design of the vehicle makes the car more efficient,
            the vehicle averages a consumption rate of 20-25 km/L.
